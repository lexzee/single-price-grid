## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

I learned how to use sass/scss that allows for more functionalities outside the scope of vanilla CSS.

```scss
@import 'some_branch'
lighten($hue, 10%)
@mixin somefunc(){
  //some codes
}
@include somefun
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will continue working with sass/scss in order to build familiarity and of course to level up in general.
